# Android-PomodoroTaskApp
The application is planned to be developed based on the Pomodoro technique, which is the time management technique followed by most 
of the Japanese. 
There are six steps in the original technique:
1.	Decide on the task to be done.
2.	Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3.	Work on the task.
4.	End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5.	If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6.	After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
So, based upon the above principle, the application developed would be helpful for creating reminders for a task, 
wherein a break alert for 5 minutes would be notified to the user after every 25 minutes work. 
The application also provides an alert after every task to mark the status of every task if it is completed or not. 
It helps the users to track time spent on the task easily; it records all sessions in the database and list to the user in a list view, 
giving the user a breakdown of where the user spent his time. With the analysis made, the user can assess his performance levels and 
make self-improvements.
